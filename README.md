# IBM-Quantum-Challenge-2020
Exercises by IBM Quantum Experience

Completed the exercises of week 1 and earned a Fundamental Badge. The challenge was quite demanding of time and dedication and had fun mind daring problems to solve. I caught COVID-19 with the onset of the challenge and thus along with other workload and deadlines, I could not give my fullest to this challenge and managed to only go through week 1 exercises. Despite this, it was a great learning experience and I would come back to solve the exercises of week 2 and 3 on my own as soon as my busy schedule allows to.
